# BeatTheBlues-Treament-Analysis
Data describes patient that were treated through a computer terminal to bring improvements in depression or anxiety. Two types of populations are chosen randomly to receive a Beat the Blue treatment and Treatment as usual (TAU). Multiple self-reports were conducted and a Social Adjustment scale which is another report. The treatment showed success in improvement in depression or anxiety. The data contains a total of 100 observations. The first variable is whether if the patients were taking any anti-depressants during treatment, which is categorical. Length is the how depression lasted in terms of 6 months, that is quantitative. Treatment is the type of treatment the patients were given whether it was Beat the Blues or treatment as usual. I believe it’s a categorical variable. Multiple bdi’s represent the self-assessment called “Beck Depression inventory” and the corresponding months, “bid.pre” was done before the treatment began. These variables are quantitative.
