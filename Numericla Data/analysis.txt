The distribution is approximately normal since it is somewhat close to symmetric, and unimodal. Creating a shape that is very close to a bell.

If the total area for a Normal Distribution 1 then 0.50 of the data will be located with the interquartile range from Q1 to Q3. In this case the random probability of choosing a data observation is approximately equal to 0.50, within Q1 and Q3. Considering that Q1 and Q3 are in the middle, and the probability is 0.50 it matches with that of a Normal Distribution. As well as data 0.25 of the data is located above Q3 in a normal distribution graph, in the calculations for a random observation for Q3 is approximately 0.25. The shape of the graph is also approximately symmetric and unimodal. Therefore, my data is approximately normal.
